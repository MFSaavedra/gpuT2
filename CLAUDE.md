# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

University assignment (Tarea 2, course CC7515-1 "Computación en GPU", U. de Chile): implement
Conway's Game of Life three times — sequential **CPU**, **CUDA**, and **OpenCL** — then benchmark
cells-evaluated-per-second across grid sizes and report the GPU speed-up vs CPU. This branch
(`static_load_balancing`) adds a fourth, **hybrid CPU+GPU** backend that splits the board with **static
load balancing** (Divisible Load Theory, Barlas §11.3) — see the `HybridEngine` bullet below.

This branch (`cuda_gl_interop`) adds **Tarea 3** (option 1, "Interop – Shaders"): a real-time **Qt +
OpenGL viewer** (`gol_gui`) for the same simulation, using **CUDA↔OpenGL interop** so the GPU-computed
board is displayed without a host round trip. See the `gol_gui` bullet under Current state.

**Rule variant (do not use vanilla Conway rules):** a dead cell is born on **exactly 3 OR exactly 6**
live neighbours; a live cell survives on 2 or 3. The extra "birth on 6" rule is the one detail that's
easy to get wrong — it must hold in every implementation (CPU, CUDA, OpenCL). This is the named rule
**HighLife** (`B36/S23`), which is convenient: Golly and other tools simulate it directly, so they can
cross-check our backends (see Tests).

## Current state

The engine/renderer **strategy** layout below is in place. What exists and works:

- **Core** — backend-agnostic `Grid` (header-only), `Config` + CLI parser, `LifeRules.hpp` (the shared
  variant rule), the `Pattern` / `RleLoader` data pipeline, and the `ISimEngine` / `IRenderer` interfaces.
- **CpuEngine** (`ISimEngine`) — implemented. A single code path serves both the **sequential** baseline
  (`threads == 1`, no synchronisation) and the **data-parallel** mode (`threads >= 2`, a persistent worker
  pool synchronised with the header-only `gol::Barrier` (`Barrier.hpp`), a reusable two-phase barrier used
  in place of C++20's `std::barrier`; `threads == 0` = all hardware cores). Both only partition the
  rows, so they produce bit-for-bit identical boards.
- **Renderers** — `NullRenderer` (header-only, for benchmarking), `TextRenderer` (scrolling text
  dump), and `AnsiRenderer` (in-place ANSI animation; clips big grids to the terminal viewport). Both
  visible renderers draw each live cell as **two** full blocks `██` (U+2588) and dead as two spaces, so
  cells read as squares despite the ~1:2 terminal cell aspect ratio; glyph fields are `std::string`
  (configurable). `AnsiRenderer` clips by per-cell display width (2 cols/cell), not raw column count.
  On a TTY it is **interactive**: arrow keys pan the viewport over a grid larger than the screen,
  `space`/`p` pauses (the sim halts but you can still pan), and `q` quits (via `shouldClose()`).
  Scrollbars (`┃`/`━` thumbs along the right/bottom edges) show the scroll position when clipped, and
  the viewer **holds on the final frame until `q`** (via `staysOpen()`). It uses raw, non-blocking
  input and restores the terminal on exit and on SIGINT/SIGTERM. Pause is contained in `render()` (a
  `do/while`), so the main loop/engine/interface are untouched; piped (non-TTY), the controls are
  disabled, `staysOpen()` is false, and the top-left window is shown once.
- **App** — `main.cpp` owns the loop, wires a CPU engine + renderer, seeds from RLE or a deterministic
  random fill, and prints kernel/wall cells-per-second.

- **CudaEngine** (`ISimEngine`) — implemented. One thread per cell over a 2D grid of blocks; owns two
  device buffers and ping-pongs on the device. Two runtime-selectable kernels: plain global-memory and
  a shared-memory tiled variant with a 1-cell halo (`--shared`); block size (`--block`) maps to a
  32-wide tile for coalesced loads. Kernel timed with `cudaEvent_t` (excludes transfers); reuses
  `nextState` from `LifeRules.hpp` verbatim. Verified **bit-for-bit against the `CpuEngine` oracle**
  across block sizes, shared/global, and both edge modes (`cuda_equivalence_test.cpp`). Opt-in via
  `-DBUILD_CUDA=ON`; targets `sm_75` (GTX 1660 Ti) with `-lineinfo` for `ncu`.

- **OpenCLEngine** (`ISimEngine`) — implemented. Mirrors the CUDA design: one work-item per cell over a
  2D NDRange, two device buffers ping-ponged on the device, and two runtime-selectable kernels — plain
  global-memory `life_global` and a local-memory tiled variant with a 1-cell halo (`life_local`, via
  `--shared`); the work-group maps to a 32-wide local size, like CUDA's tile. The kernel source
  `kernel.cl` is **read at runtime** (`clCreateProgramWithSource`) and mirrors `nextState` + the edge
  rule in plain C; kernel timed with `CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE` command-queue events (excludes
  transfers). Verified **bit-for-bit against the `CpuEngine` oracle** at runtime via
  `--engine opencl --verify` and a `gol_opencl_tests` gtest (see Tests). Opt-in via `-DBUILD_OPENCL=ON`; on an
  NVIDIA box the platform is "NVIDIA CUDA", so it lowers through the same PTX/SASS backend as CUDA.

- **HybridEngine** (`ISimEngine`) — implemented (this branch, `static_load_balancing`). Runs the **CPU
  and a GPU together on one board**, split by rows via **static load balancing / Divisible Load Theory**
  (Barlas §11.3). Row-wise domain decomposition: the CPU owns rows `[0,s)` (host buffers + the same
  persistent `std::barrier` worker pool as `CpuEngine`), the GPU owns `[s,R)` (device buffers); each side
  keeps its slice resident and ping-pongs locally, and the full board is reassembled only on
  `download()`. Each generation they compute **concurrently** and exchange a **one-row ghost halo** at the
  seam (and, under `--wrap`, the far edges) — the only per-step host↔device traffic. A dedicated
  **halo kernel** (`lifeHalo` in `kernel.cu`, `life_halo` in `kernel.cl`) reads vertical neighbours from
  ghost rows and applies only the horizontal edge rule, so it is **bit-for-bit identical to the
  `CpuEngine` oracle in both edge modes**. The split `s` is chosen **once** — from `--cpu-frac F`
  (an offline cost-model value) or, by default, a short **a-priori calibration phase** that times a few
  CPU-only and GPU-only steps and picks the DLT optimum `part_gpu = R_gpu/(R_cpu+R_gpu)` — then **frozen**
  for the whole run. The GPU side is abstracted behind `IHaloPartition` (CUDA/OpenCL impls in the gated
  libs, selected by `--gpu-backend`); the hybrid uses the **global-memory** halo kernel only (`--shared`
  is not applied to it). Opt-in: built whenever a GPU backend is configured. Verified via
  `--engine hybrid --verify` and a `gol_hybrid_tests` gtest. **Finding:** on this box the GPU is ~200×
  the CPU, so the DLT-optimal split is ~99.5% GPU and the per-step coordination overhead (ghost exchange
  + pool wakeup for a tiny CPU share) slightly exceeds the gain — the hybrid ≈ pure GPU here, the
  textbook DLT regime where one node dominates.

- **Benchmarks** — run. `scripts/sweep.sh` drives the CPU(threads) + CUDA + OpenCL (block×shared/local)
  sweeps; on the Linux box they go to `results/linux/sweep_{gpu_opt,scaling}.csv`, and
  `analysis/results.ipynb` (Spanish, reads `results/linux/`) plots them to `report/img/bench_*.png`.
  Headline: on Linux both GPU backends peak together — **CUDA ~35 Gcells/s, OpenCL ~37** (on NVIDIA
  OpenCL lowers through the same PTX/SASS backend, so it matches CUDA), ~240–250× over the best parallel
  CPU; **shared/local memory is slower** (~0.5×, a ~1.8–2.1× penalty on *both* engines) and block 64–128
  is optimal. (A Windows baseline committed on `prefinal`, `results/sweep_*.csv` with a BOM, shows OpenCL
  anomalously ~20× slow — an unhealthy Windows ICD path, not representative; the Linux data is the real
  story.) `ncu` corrected the roofline: the kernel is **not** DRAM-bound —
  L2 serves ~88% of requests so DRAM sees ~2 B/cell at ~20% util; it's latency/L2-pipe-bound (~65% SOL).
  `nsys`: ~30 µs/step launch overhead, H2D 8.4 GB/s (pageable `std::vector`). Report Resultados/Análisis,
  §Cotas, and §Perfilamiento are filled from this (`results/profiling/*.ncu-rep`).

- **`gol_gui`** — Qt + OpenGL viewer (this branch, Tarea 3). A **separate executable** from the headless
  `gol`: Qt owns the event loop (`QApplication::exec`), so it cannot reuse `main.cpp`'s generation loop or
  the `IRenderer` seam (which assumes host data); it is a peer front-end on the same core. It drives any
  `ISimEngine` and presents the board through one of two paths chosen at init:
  - **Interop** (zero-copy): a CUDA engine writes its current device buffer straight into a GL-registered
    PBO (device→device, no PCIe round trip), which OpenGL streams into a `GL_R8UI` texture. Used when a
    `CudaEngine` runs against a GL context on the same (NVIDIA) GPU.
  - **HostUpload**: the board is `download()`ed to host memory and uploaded to the texture each frame.
    Used for the **CPU engine** (so the viewer builds/runs with no CUDA toolkit), and as a graceful
    **fallback** when interop is unavailable (e.g. a GL context on an Optimus iGPU — see below).

  A fragment shader colours each cell in one of three **colour modes** (binary, live-neighbour count, or
  an **age heatmap** — colour by generations survived) through a selectable **palette** (grayscale (default) /
  phosphor / amber / magma / ice / **spectrum**), and draws **grid lines** around cells once zoomed in past
  ~4 px/cell; a
  fullscreen-triangle vertex shader needs no VBO. (**spectrum** rotates hue red→green→blue at fixed
  brightness, intended for the age heatmap — the single-hue ramps like phosphor/grayscale only vary
  brightness, so young vs. old cells are hard to tell apart there.) Shaders are GL 3.3 core, **read at runtime** from
  `src/gui/shaders/` (like `kernel.cl`). The age heatmap keeps a host-side per-cell "generations survived"
  buffer (`age_`) in a second `GL_R8UI` texture, updated once per generation and only while that mode is
  active, so the other modes (and the interop zero-copy path) never pay for it. Interactive: wheel zoom,
  middle/right-drag pan, left-drag paint (Shift erases, via the new `ISimEngine::pokeCell`), keys
  space/S/R/C/I/F and **P** (save a PNG screenshot of the view to the CWD via `grabFramebuffer`), and a Qt
  control panel (play/pause, step, reset, reseed, clear, **Open RLE…**, **Screenshot**, speed, colour mode,
  palette, wrap). CLI mirrors the headless `gol` flags
  (`--rows/--cols/--gens/--threads/--wrap/--seed/--rle/--engine cpu|cuda/--block` + `COLSxROWS`); `--gens`
  is an interactive auto-pause. Each frame **presents the current board then steps** (not step-then-present),
  so a freshly painted cell is visible the frame it is drawn before it evolves; **reset** restores a
  generation-0 snapshot (seed / last-loaded pattern), kept separate from the host-upload scratch board.
  **Optimus caveat:** on this hybrid-graphics box OpenGL defaults to the
  Intel iGPU, on which interop is unavailable (it falls back to host-upload); `scripts/run_gui.sh` sets
  PRIME-offload env vars so the GL context lands on the NVIDIA GPU and the zero-copy path is used.

All three backends (plus the hybrid) now run and verify against the `CpuEngine` reference oracle. GPU
CMake targets are opt-in and double-gated (the option **and** the source must exist); the project still
builds and runs (CPU + text) with neither toolkit present, in which case `--engine hybrid` reports the
backend as unavailable. The chosen optimization options to benchmark are **#1 block size** and **#3
shared/local memory** (the `--block` / `--shared` knobs); option #2 (2D vs 1D arrays) is not used — the
`Grid` is flat 1-D.

## Build & test

Requires a C++17 compiler and CMake ≥ 3.18. (The codebase uses no C++20/23 feature;
the one C++20 use, `std::barrier`, is replaced by the header-only `gol::Barrier` in
`Barrier.hpp`. The `compatibility` branch lowered these floors from C++23 / CMake 3.28.)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build              # core + CPU engine + tests (GPU targets OFF by default)
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

GPU targets are opt-in:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_CUDA=ON -DBUILD_OPENCL=ON
```

The Qt + OpenGL viewer (`gol_gui`) is opt-in via `-DBUILD_GUI=ON` (needs **Qt5 or Qt6**: Core, Gui,
Widgets, plus OpenGL/OpenGLWidgets on Qt6 — under Qt5 those classes live in Gui/Widgets. CMake uses
`find_package(QT NAMES Qt6 Qt5 …)`, preferring Qt6). It does **not** require CUDA — without
`-DBUILD_CUDA=ON` it builds CPU-only (host-upload
display); with `-DBUILD_CUDA=ON` it additionally offers the zero-copy CUDA/GL interop path:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_CUDA=ON -DBUILD_GUI=ON
cmake --build build --target gol_gui
./scripts/run_gui.sh 1024x1024 --rle patterns/highlife_replicator.rle   # NVIDIA GL context (zero-copy)
./build/gol_gui --engine cpu 512x512                                     # CPU engine, runs anywhere
```

`scripts/run_gui.sh` sets PRIME-offload env vars (`__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD`, `__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME`,
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`) so the GL context is on the NVIDIA GPU; a bare `./build/gol_gui` still runs but
falls back to host-upload on an Optimus iGPU context.

Run a subset of tests via ctest regex:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build -R Rules --output-on-failure
```

GoogleTest is found via `find_package(GTest CONFIG)` if installed system-wide; otherwise it is fetched
(v1.17.0) and built automatically. Tests are registered with `gtest_discover_tests`.

## Architecture

Strategy pattern. A backend-agnostic core (`Grid`, `Config`, patterns) plus two swappable interfaces —
`ISimEngine` (the only thing that genuinely differs per backend) and `IRenderer` (output). The
`HybridEngine` is itself an `ISimEngine` that *composes* a CPU slice with a GPU slice behind a third,
internal strategy interface, `IHaloPartition` (CUDA/OpenCL impls in the gated libs) — so the hybrid
stays free of any toolkit headers and selects the device at runtime. The application owns the loop and
wires a chosen engine + renderer at runtime:

```
gol (headless app: main loop, Config/CLI)
  |-- ISimEngine   <- CpuEngine | CudaEngine | OpenCLEngine | HybridEngine
  |                     '-- HybridEngine drives a CPU slice + an IHaloPartition
  |                         (<- CudaHaloPartition | OpenCLHaloPartition) GPU slice
  |-- IRenderer    <- NullRenderer | TextRenderer | AnsiRenderer
  '-- Grid + Patterns (shared, backend-agnostic)

gol_gui (Qt front-end: Qt owns the loop; not an IRenderer)
  |-- ISimEngine   <- CpuEngine | CudaEngine     (driven directly by GolGlWidget)
  '-- present path  <- CudaGlInterop (zero-copy PBO) | host-upload (download -> texture)
```

Loop (headless): render the seed as generation 0, then `engine->step()` -> (only if a renderer is
attached) `engine->download(grid)` -> `renderer->render(grid, gen+1)` -> repeat. Under `NullRenderer`
the download + render are skipped entirely, so host<->device transfers never enter the benchmark.

The **GUI is a separate front-end**, not an `IRenderer`: Qt's `QApplication::exec()` owns the loop and
calls back into `GolGlWidget` (a `QOpenGLWidget`), so it cannot be plugged into the headless loop or the
`render(const Grid&)` seam (which presupposes host data — the very copy interop avoids). The widget owns
the engine and a `CudaGlInterop` bridge; per frame it steps on the GPU, moves the board into a texture
(zero-copy interop or host-upload), and draws a fullscreen quad. `gol_gui` is gated on `BUILD_GUI` and is
independent of the headless `gol`, which never links Qt or OpenGL.

Interfaces:

- `ISimEngine`: `upload(const Grid&)`, `step()`, `download(Grid&)`, `lastKernelMillis() const`,
  `name() const`, virtual dtor, plus `pokeCell(x, y, value)` (default no-op; overridden by `CpuEngine`
  and `CudaEngine` for the GUI's mouse paint — backends that don't support live editing degrade
  gracefully). CUDA/OpenCL engines own their device buffers and do the double-buffer ping-pong
  internally (read A -> write B -> swap). `CudaEngine` also exposes `rows()/cols()/currentDeviceBuffer()`
  for the interop viewer.
- `IRenderer`: `render(const Grid&, uint64_t gen)`, `shouldClose()`/`staysOpen()` (both default false).
  `NullRenderer` does
  nothing — **always benchmark against it** so render/print cost never pollutes cells/sec. `TextRenderer`
  appends each frame (scrolls); `AnsiRenderer` redraws in place via ANSI escapes and clips to the
  terminal viewport (it never wraps, since a wrapped row would desync its cursor-home math).

Grid: a flat, row-major `std::vector<unsigned char>` indexed `r * cols_ + c`. It exposes dims, an
`at(x,y)` accessor, and the raw pointer; engines hold their own ping-pong buffers. Keep this layout
identical across backends so one host-side harness and the equivalence test can drive all three.

Rule sharing (minimise duplication): write the variant rule **once** in `LifeRules.hpp` as an inline
neighbour-count + birth/survive helper, qualified `__host__ __device__` under `#ifdef __CUDACC__` so
CPU and CUDA share it verbatim. OpenCL can't include C++ headers, so it mirrors the same helper in a
plain-C `kernel.cl` that is **read at runtime** (not embedded as a string literal); keep it diff-able
against `LifeRules.hpp`. Don't chase zero duplication between CUDA and OpenCL — it costs more clarity
than it saves. Edge handling (bounded vs toroidal) must also be identical across backends. **Default is
bounded** (out-of-range neighbours count as dead); `--wrap` selects toroidal. `CpuEngine` implements
both, the seq-vs-parallel test covers each mode, and the GPU backends must match it bit-for-bit in both.
The `HybridEngine` realises edges differently: its halo kernel never does vertical edge logic — the host
fills each slice's ghost rows per edge mode (bounded → dead/zero far ghosts; toroidal → wrap onto the
other slice) — while the horizontal edge rule stays in-kernel. Same `nextState`/`next_state`, same
result, both modes.

CMake: a core library (always), a CPU engine (always), CUDA/OpenCL engine libraries gated on
`BUILD_CUDA` / `BUILD_OPENCL`, a hybrid engine library (`gol_hybrid`) gated on *at least one* GPU
backend being configured (it links whichever of `gol_cuda` / `gol_opencl` exists and is compiled by the
host C++ compiler, not nvcc), and renderer sources. The project must build and run (CPU + text) with
no CUDA toolkit and no OpenCL present. The `gol_gui` executable is gated on `BUILD_GUI` (finds Qt5 or Qt6); it
always links the CPU engine, and when `BUILD_CUDA` is also on it builds the `gol_cudagl` interop bridge
(nvcc), links the CUDA engine, and defines `GOL_HAVE_CUDA`.

```

Per the report plan (`report/main.tex`), the two kernel-config variations to benchmark are block sizes
{32, 64, 128, 256} and shared/local memory vs none. Both are runtime-selectable on the GPU
engines (e.g. `--block`, `--shared`) so the same binary drives every benchmark configuration.

## Timing & profiling

Headline metric: **cells evaluated per second** = `rows * cols * generations / elapsed`. Always
benchmark with the `NullRenderer` so output cost doesn't pollute the numbers.

For sweep data, `--csv` prints one data row per run (columns:
`backend,rows,cols,generations,threads,block,shared,wrap,kernel_ms,wall_ms,mcells_kernel,mcells_wall`)
and `--csv-header` prints just the header line and exits — so a script does
`gol --csv-header > out.csv` once, then appends `gol … --csv >> out.csv` per config (Pandas-ready).

Use uniform in-program event timing so all three backends are measured the same way (don't rely on a
profiler for the comparison numbers), exposed via `ISimEngine::lastKernelMillis()`. Report kernel time
separately from host<->device transfers:

- CPU: `std::chrono`.
- CUDA: `cudaEvent_t` around the kernel launch.
- OpenCL: command-queue events with `CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE`.
- Hybrid: `std::chrono` around the whole concurrent step (the CPU slice and GPU kernel run together, so
  the relevant figure is the wall of the parallel region ≈ max of the two nodes, not either alone). The
  calibration phase runs in `upload()`, so it lands in the upload time, never in the cells/sec metric.

Deep-dive on the *best* parallel solution only:

- **Nsight Compute (`ncu`)** — CUDA kernel-internal metrics (occupancy, stalls, memory throughput).
  CUDA/OptiX only; it will **not** profile OpenCL.
- **Nsight Systems (`nsys`)** — system/timeline view; can also trace OpenCL on NVIDIA hardware.

Analysis (now measured + profiled): this is a memory-bound, arithmetically trivial 9-point stencil over
1-byte cells. Measured: block size is concave, peaking at **64-128**; shared memory **hurts** (~0.55x)
because L2 already serves the reuse. `ncu` refined the picture — the global kernel is **not**
DRAM-bandwidth-bound (DRAM at ~20%, q≈2 B/cell via 88% L2 hit) but **latency / L2-pipe-bound** (~65% SOL).
Launch/transfer overhead dominates only at small grids, so run the sweeps at large N x M.

## Tests

In dependency order (`CpuEngine` is the oracle, so it is verified first):

1. **CpuEngine correctness** under the variant rule — done. Block stays still, blinker oscillates
   period-2, and the birth-on-6 case brings a dead cell with 6 neighbours alive (`rules_test.cpp`).
2. **Sequential vs. parallel equivalence** — done. Same seed + generations must give a bit-for-bit
   identical board across thread counts and both edge modes, including non-divisible grids that exercise
   the row-remainder logic (`cpu_parallel_test.cpp`).
3. **RLE loader + `Pattern::applyTo`** — done. Parsing, stamping, clipping, missing-file errors
   (`rle_loader_test.cpp`). `compile_smoke_test.cpp` also includes every header so the scaffolding stays
   build-clean.
4. **Cross-backend equivalence** — done for both GPU backends. `cuda_equivalence_test.cpp` and
   `opencl_equivalence_test.cpp` seed their engine and CPU identically and assert bit-for-bit equality
   against the `CpuEngine` oracle across block sizes {32,64,128,256}, shared/global (local) kernels, and
   both edge modes (plus a birth-on-6 device check); each also checks the host↔device round-trip (no
   step, isolating the transfer path) and buffer reuse across grid sizes on one engine instance. Built
   only when the matching engine was configured — `gol_cuda_tests` under `-DBUILD_CUDA=ON`,
   `gol_opencl_tests` under `-DBUILD_OPENCL=ON` — and each needs its GPU/OpenCL device at run time.

5. **Hybrid equivalence** — done. `hybrid_equivalence_test.cpp` asserts the `HybridEngine` matches the
   `CpuEngine` oracle bit-for-bit across CPU fractions {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1} (the 0 and 1 ends exercise
   the degenerate pure-GPU / pure-CPU paths), an auto-calibrated split, sequential vs parallel CPU
   slices, and both edge modes, on a non-divisible grid (so the split lands mid-block). It also covers a
   birth-on-6 case straddling the seam, the no-step round-trip, and reuse across sizes — for every GPU
   backend compiled in. Built as `gol_hybrid_tests` whenever the hybrid engine is configured; needs a
   GPU/OpenCL device at run time.

**Golly as an external oracle.** Golly is installed locally, including the headless `bgolly` runner
(infinite grid, no edge effects). It runs our exact rule (`B36/S23`), so it is a second, independent
reference: `bgolly -m <gens> -i <step> file.rle` prints populations to compare against ours. The
`highlife_replicator.rle` / `highlife_spaceship.rle` fixtures in `patterns/` were verified this way and
reproduce `bgolly` bit-for-bit, so they make good large-grid cross-checks for the GPU backends.

## Report

LaTeX sources are in `report/`, built from a vendored template (`report/src/`, `report/template.tex`).
There are **three** standalone documents, all built the same way:

- `report/main.tex` — the **graded assignment report** (Spanish). Full section skeleton with the
  grading rubric noted in comments; holds experiments, results, speed-up analysis.
- `report/manual.tex` — the **developer manual** (English). Architecture, mechanism, and a
  line-by-line code walkthrough; the reference for how/why the code works.
- `report/hybrid_report.tex` — a standalone **engineering report** (English) analysing the hybrid
  CPU+GPU static-load-balancing sweep: throughput results, the DLT split, the key finding that the
  apparent large-N "win" is the branch-free halo kernel (not load balancing), and the OpenCL ICD /
  GPU-variance caveats. Embeds `report/img/hybrid_load_balancing.png`.

```bash
cd report && latexmk -pdf main.tex      # or: latexmk -pdf manual.tex, latexmk -pdf hybrid_report.tex
```

**Architecture UML.** The class diagram source is `report/diagrams/architecture.mmd` (Mermaid),
rendered with mermaid-cli to `report/img/uml_architecture.{svg,pdf,png}` — the PDF is embedded in the
manual (Figure 1) and the PNG is for the assignment report. Regenerate after architecture changes:

```bash
# -c mermaid-config.json sets htmlLabels:false -> native SVG <text> (not <foreignObject>),
# so rsvg-convert renders text into the PDF; -p sets Chromium's --no-sandbox for this env.
mmdc -i report/diagrams/architecture.mmd -o report/img/uml_architecture.svg \
     -p report/diagrams/puppeteer.json -c report/diagrams/mermaid-config.json -b white -t neutral
rsvg-convert -f pdf -o report/img/uml_architecture.pdf report/img/uml_architecture.svg
mmdc -i report/diagrams/architecture.mmd -o report/img/uml_architecture.png \
     -p report/diagrams/puppeteer.json -c report/diagrams/mermaid-config.json -b white -t neutral -s 3
```

**CUDA index-mapping diagrams.** Three Graphviz sources in `report/diagrams/` explain how the 1-D
flat `Grid` maps onto the 2-D CUDA thread/block geometry (the "three coordinate spaces" subsection in
the manual and the CUDA implementation subsection in the report): `cuda_coordinate_spaces.dot`
(execution → board → memory + the two maps), `cuda_block_mapping.dot` (a block is a rectangle on the
board but two discontiguous runs in memory, `cols - bx` apart — scaled down to a 4×2 block to fit),
and `cuda_stencil_addressing.dot` (the 9-point stencil as memory offsets: ±1 horizontal, ±cols
vertical). Each renders to `report/img/<name>.{pdf,png}` (PDF embedded in both `.tex` via
`\insertimage`). Regenerate after changing the kernel's index math:

```bash
for d in cuda_coordinate_spaces cuda_block_mapping cuda_stencil_addressing; do
  dot -Tpdf report/diagrams/$d.dot -o report/img/$d.pdf
  dot -Tpng -Gdpi=200 report/diagrams/$d.dot -o report/img/$d.png
done
```

The assignment statement is `Tarea_2_Enunciado.pdf` (in Spanish) — the source of truth for requirements.

## Documentation maintenance

**IMPORTANT — keep the docs in sync with the code.** This repo treats three documents as living
artifacts: `report/manual.tex` (developer manual), `report/main.tex` (assignment report), and this
`CLAUDE.md`. Whenever you **add, remove, or change a source file in a way that alters behaviour,
structure, the file layout, the CLI/flag surface, the timing methodology, or the rule/edge handling,
update all three affected documents in the same change** — do not defer it. Specifically:

- **`report/manual.tex`** — update the relevant section and the file map (Table `tab:files`). New
  source files get a section + a row; changed mechanisms get their walkthrough/snippet updated;
  removed files get their entry deleted. Keep code snippets matching the real code (em-dashes inside
  `sourcecode` listings must be `--`; escape `_`, `$`, `#`, `%`, `&` in *captions* and prose; a raw
  `█`/Unicode glyph in LaTeX text breaks pdflatex — describe it as "U+2588" instead). If the class or
  relationship structure changes, update the UML source `report/diagrams/architecture.mmd` and
  re-render `report/img/uml_architecture.*` (commands under "Report").
- **`report/main.tex`** — update only when results, experiments, or methodology move (e.g. a GPU
  backend lands, a benchmark is run, a config variation changes). It is the graded report.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — update "Current state", the layout tree, and any affected section (Build, Tests,
  Architecture, Timing) so this file never describes code that no longer exists.

The most common trigger is landing the CUDA or OpenCL backend: that touches the manual's rule,
CPU-oracle, tests, timing, and roadmap sections; the report's implementation + results sections; and
this file's "Current state" and layout. After editing, rebuild both PDFs (`latexmk -pdf`) to confirm
they still compile.
